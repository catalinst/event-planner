## Hot it works

- frontend solution sits in the `/frontend` folder, navigate there, run `npm i` and after `npm start`
- backend solution can be found `/backend` folder. For database, I used MongoDB, probably you will need to install some
  tools for that like the driver (Atlas) and some GUI (Compass)
